## Team Name: DSAR-inc

**High-Level Project Summary**

The project is an automatic feeder for cats, which will dispense food for kittens (1 or 2 times a day depending on the consensus) at pre-established times. Thus, the final product will be integrated into a mobile application which will be connected to a database that will constantly monitor the level of food and will alert the user where the food is less than 15%.

# Detailed Project Description

## What exactly does it do?

Our project will focus on making smart feeders that are activated by schedules programmable by the user of the app, so they will consist of a physical part in which a design of a feeder will be made which will be controlled by an ESP32 card which will allow control the sensors that will indicate the level of food, the buttons and the security indicators, in addition to providing connectivity with a Firebase database that will allow the user with an app and monitor the feeders in real time.

## How does it work?
We will implement our prototype through the use of design and modeling in the physical part, regarding the control part the ESP32 will be the controller of our device, and finally in the programming part through Android Studio we will implement the application so that users can interact endings.

## What benefits does it have
The direct benefit is focused on the cats and dogs that are fed by the animal care organizations, however it also helps the organization by having a greater monitoring of the feeders, helping in the management.

## What do you hope to achieve
Since this project is a prototype, we hope to create a fully functional prototype that correctly measures the level of food and allows the user to have control over both its location and schedules. While as widgets in the future it is thought to incorporate a camera to carry out a feeding based on the incidence of pets and have control of the correct operation of the feeder in the event of possible failures.

## What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?
We will use different software based on each of the PetFeeder components:
* In the physical part: some modeling software like Inventor or SW (to be defined).
* In the electronic or control part: As hardware the ESP32 card, and as programming language C++.
* In the app part (the focus of this repository): Android Studio will be used for native development, and Firebase as a database.
